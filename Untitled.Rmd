# 2. Need for Road Safety & Transport Regulation update

In the last 8 years (2012-2019), motor vehicle crashes (MVC) has increased from `r (MVC_data$Time[1]) `
___ in ___  to ___ in ____, which is a increase of ___ %.
```{r echo = FALSE}

data_path <- "MVC_compiled_data.xlsx"
MVC_data_original <-  readxl::read_xlsx(data_path)

MVC_data <- MVC_data_original %>% 
    select(-no_MVC)

MVC_data <-  MVC_data %>% 
    pivot_longer(-Time, names_to = "Elements", values_to = "Frequency") %>% 
    separate(Elements, c("crash_severity", "gender"), sep = "_")

MVC_data %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Frequency, color = gender)) +
    geom_line() +
    facet_grid(crash_severity~.,) +

- increasing MVC
- increasing TIN
- repeated offenders
